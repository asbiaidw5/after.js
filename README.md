# After.js


If next.js and react-router had a baby, it'd be this.

## Playing around with the example

```
git clone git@github.com:jaredpalmer/after.js.git
cd after.js 
yarn install
```

open the basic example

```
cd examples/basic
yarn start
```

Open localhost:3000 and look at the `pages` directiory


### Todo
- HMR duh (need to pull it out of razzle)
- Code splitting
- Make data fetching more lit and recursive
