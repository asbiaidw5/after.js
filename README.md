# After.js


If next.js and react-router had a baby, it'd be this.


```
npm i after 
```


- Make a directory called `./pages`
- Make a React components...

```
import React from 'react';

class Home extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Home
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Home;
```



- Add a file called `_routes.js`
